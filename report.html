      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>Sanketa (Sanskrit: meaning "signal" or "sign") represents a transformative vision for India's traffic management infrastructure. This comprehensive project report details the development, implementation, and deployment strategy for an AI-powered adaptive traffic signal system designed specifically for Indian road conditions and traffic patterns.</p>
      <p>India faces unprecedented traffic congestion challenges. According to the TomTom Traffic Index 2024, Indian drivers lose approximately 94 hours annually due to traffic congestion. With over 435,000 road accidents occurring each year and approximately 180 deaths due to ambulance delays in Pakistan alone (similar conditions exist in India), the need for intelligent traffic management has never been more critical.</p>
      <p>Sanketa proposes a cost-effective, scalable, and robust AI-based traffic management solution that combines computer vision, RFID technology, and adaptive signal control algorithms to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, improve emergency vehicle response times, and minimize environmental impact. The system is designed to function offline, making it suitable for deployment across diverse Indian cities, including those with limited internet infrastructure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25-50% reduction in average vehicle delay at intersections</li>
        <li>40-60% faster emergency vehicle response times</li>
        <li>30-45% reduction in fuel consumption at traffic signals</li>
        <li>20-35% decrease in carbon emissions</li>
        <li>Significant improvement in overall traffic flow and road safety</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This report presents a detailed analysis of the system architecture, AI algorithms, hardware requirements, implementation roadmap, cost-benefit analysis, and case studies from successful deployments worldwide.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction and Problem Statement</h2>
      <h3>1.1 The Traffic Crisis in India</h3>
      <p>India's rapid urbanization has created unprecedented challenges for traffic management. Between 2010 and 2024, the number of registered vehicles in India increased from 142 million to over 330 million, representing a growth of more than 130%. However, road infrastructure has not kept pace with this exponential growth.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bengaluru:</strong> Known as India's Silicon Valley, commuters face average delays of 243 hours per year</li>
        <li><strong>Mumbai:</strong> The financial capital experiences peak hour speeds as low as 8-12 km/h</li>
        <li><strong>Delhi NCR:</strong> Hosts over 12 million vehicles, with congestion levels exceeding 60% during peak hours</li>
        <li><strong>Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai:</strong> Each experiencing 40-50% year-over-year traffic volume increases</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.2 Limitations of Current Traffic Management Systems</h3>
      <p>Traditional traffic signal systems in India operate on fixed-time cycles, typically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Green phase: 30-60 seconds</li>
        <li>Yellow phase: 3-5 seconds</li>
        <li>Red phase: 30-60 seconds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This approach has fundamental flaws:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No Real-Time Adaptation: Signals cannot respond to actual traffic conditions</li>
        <li>Equal Time Allocation: Busy and empty roads receive the same green time</li>
        <li>No Emergency Priority: Ambulances and fire vehicles wait at red lights</li>
        <li>Peak Hour Inefficiency: Manual intervention required by traffic police</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.3 The Sanketa Vision</h3>

      <h4>2.1.1 SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimization Technique)</h4>
      <p>Developed in the UK in the 1980s, SCOOT was one of the first adaptive traffic control systems. It uses inductive loop detectors embedded in roads to measure traffic flow and adjusts signal timings accordingly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyclic flow adjustment based on upstream/downstream demand</li>
        <li>Region-wide optimization across signal networks</li>
        <li>Proven 12-15% reduction in delays</li>
        <li>Limitations: Requires extensive road infrastructure modification, high installation and maintenance costs, not suitable for heterogeneous traffic</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2.1.2 SURTRAC (Scalable Urban Traffic Control)</h4>
      <p>Developed by Carnegie Mellon University and deployed in Pittsburgh, USA, SURTRAC uses distributed AI agents at each intersection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25-40% reduction in travel time</li>
        <li>20-30% reduction in vehicle emissions</li>
        <li>30-35% reduction in fuel consumption</li>
        <li>Key Innovation: Decentralized decision-making with inter-signal communication</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <h3>2.3 RFID Technology in Traffic Management</h3>
      <p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) provides vehicle identification and tracking capabilities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RFID Tags: Passive or active transponders attached to vehicles</li>
        <li>RFID Readers: Installed at intersections to detect tags</li>
        <li>Processing Unit: Arduino/Raspberry Pi microcontrollers</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2.3.2 King County Case Study (USA)</h4>
      <p>King County Metro Transit System implemented RFID-based Transit Signal Priority (TSP) in 1999. Results: Reduced intersection delay by 25-34%, fewer stops, more consistent travel times.</p>
      <h3>2.4 IoT and V2X Communication</h3>
      <p>Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enables vehicles to interact with infrastructure and each other.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure): Vehicles receive real-time signal timing information, route optimization, emergency vehicle notification</li>
        <li>V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle): Cooperative vehicle positioning, collision avoidance, platoon formation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.5 Indian Context: Challenges and Adaptations</h3>
